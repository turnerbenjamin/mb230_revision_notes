# Customer Voice

## What is it?

It is a surveying tool allowing you to communicate with customers to gain input.

Touchpoints, or moments of truth, are the points at which we will look for 
feedback.

## Surveys

There are various types:

- Choice
- Date
- Rating
- Ranking
- Test
- Likert Ranking (level of agreement on a scale)
- NPS 

With NPS detractors are 1-6, passives (7-8) and promoters (9-10)

## Building a Survey

### Make a Project

All surveys are built and stored in projects. A project is created in an 
environment.

### Templates

There are various templates we can use when building a survey to help build 
these. This can be useful when learning about the tool.

### Building The Survey

Plan the survey carefully, remember that question design is very important

### Limitations

- Up to 100 questions on a survey
- Likert with 10 statements counts as 10 questions
- Longer surverys should be broken down into several pages to be less 
overwhelming

### Headers and Branding

We can customise the header and branding theming. These can be stored to reuse
across surveys

### Logic

We can use logic to change the survey based on responsed, for example show or
hide questions based on the responses.

We have actions we may perform and targets which refer to sections, questions,
urls, end of survey, chained survey etc.

### Personalisation

The first and last name variables are present in the survey by default. These
can be referenced with the name in 2 curly brackets.

We can have up to 15 variables in a given survey.

### Satisfaction Metrics

We can analyse:

- Projects
- Surveys
- Survey responses

We can add up to 10 metrics for a project, the typical ones are:

- NPS
- Sentiment (AI analyses text based questions as positive, negative or neutral)
- CSAT (Customer satisfaction based on ratings questions)

### Translations

Each survey may have up to 86 languages with 40 out of the box. The translations
must be provided manually, but there are tools to help with this.

The survey language can be set:
- Based on browser settings
- By toggling the relevant parameter
- By the user where this is enabled

### Ways of Sending a Survey

- Email
- Link or QR code
- Power Automate 
- Embedding within a website

## Visualistions

We can use Power BI to visualise analytics for surveys.
