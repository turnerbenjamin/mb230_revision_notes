# Dashboards, Charts and Views

## Create and Use Views

Views are simple ways to perform basic data analysis with options for filtering
and sorting. Each record has predefined views.

We can define views in make.powerapps

Users may create personal views. The cases grid is a view. If we edit the 
filters and columns in this view, then there is the option to save as a new
view. We must give the view a name and description.

## Create and use Charts

Charts are simple visualisations for a table. Users can view these charts by
selecting view chart from a given grid.

We can define charts for a table from make.powerapps.

Users can define personal charts. After selecting view chart, there is a 
dropdown with the option to create a new chart. This will be user scoped.

## Create and use Dashboards

Again, dashboards may be created from make.powerapps. A user may also define 
a personal dashboard from the dashboards grid.

### Dashboard Types

#### 365 Dashboard

These are dashboards users may create from the dashboard grid. We can include
simple components such as charts, lists, etc.

We can include a Power BI tile if Power BI visualisation embedding has been 
enabled in the settings.

#### Power BI Dashboard

These also need Power BI visualisation embedding to be enabled in the 
environment settings. These can be created as personal or system dashboards.

I think, we probably need to make these in Power BI first and then connect them
to Customer Service.

#### Interactive Dashboard

These are most often used in Hub. There are:
- Single stream dashboards
- Multi-stream dashboards

It is not possible to create personal interactive dashboards. These must be
created within a solution using the classic solution explorer (apparently)

## Use of Power BI

Users can select Visualise View, for example, from the active cases grid to open
a visualisation of that view. Any filters active in the view will be applied to
the visualisation.
